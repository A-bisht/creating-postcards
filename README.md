## Creating postcards with customized texts
This is a mini project where I have created postcards two with personalized texts.  
The background image is from my husband's collection.  
For the first postcard, I have used a text from google. For the second postcard, I have inserted a simple text.    
The background images are OCEAN.jpg and Bahamas.jpg. 
The foreground images are text.jpg and flower.jpeg.    
I have imported and edited codes from: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html      
The final postcard created is also attached named postcard.jpg and postcard2.jpg.
