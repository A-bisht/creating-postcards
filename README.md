## Creating postcards with customized texts
 This is a very simple project where I have created postcards with personalized texts. 
The background image credit goes to my husband.   
The foreground text/image credit goes to wwww.google.com   
I have imported and edited codes from : https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html
