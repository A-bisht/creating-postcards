## Creating postcards with customized texts
This is a mini project where I have created postcards with personalized texts.   
The background image credit goes to my husband. The attached image file is named OCEAN.jpg.  
The foreground text/image credit goes to wwww.google.com. The attached image file is named text.jpg.     
I have imported and edited codes from: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html    
The final postcard crated is also attached named postcard.jpg.
